= Mechanics
Combat takes place in rounds. Each round a character can take
one action (or two half-actions). Players decide on their
character's initial actions, reveal them, and then can use any
remaining part of their action to respond to the actions of other
characters. After responses have been decided all actions are
resolved by making rolls. Finally, any consequences of the
actions are applied and the round ends.

== Actions
To do something in combat a character needs to spend an action.
Typically an action is used to move or make a roll in order to
attack, use a skill, cast a spell, etc.

Each character has one action to spend each round and gets their
action back at the start of the next round.

=== Half-Actions
If a character wants to do two things in a round they can split
their action into two half-actions. A half action always has an
additional penalty dice (this represents rushing or acting
hastily in the game world).

=== Movement
Moving X meters costs half an action.

== Combat Phases
Each round is divided into 6 phases: Describe, Decide, Reveal,
Respond, Roll, Tidy.

=== Describe:
The *Narrator* outlines the current situation,
describing which characters are present, where they are, and any
other relevant details like terrain, conditions, etc.

*Example:* _"The three of you are standing at one end of a long,
narrow bridge made of wood and rope. At the other end are two
goblins, they appear to have seen you and are waving their
spears menacingly as they advance. Beyond the goblins the narrow
mountain track winds up into the mist, one side falling sharply
into empty space. Below the bridge a raging river flows.
A mixture of spray and mist covers everything with a slick film
of moisture."_

=== Decide
Players decide which actions their characters will take and if
they are holding back any part of their action to use in the
respond phase. They also decide on the order any actions will
happen in. The *Narrator* decides the same for the non-player
characters.

_Example_: "Bob decides to cast a defensive spell (1 action) on
Alice, Alice decides to take a full attack with a bow against
the left goblin (1 action), and Eve decides to take a quick
attack with her crossbow against the right goblin (1/2 action).
The Goblins each decide to advance half way across the bridge
(1/2 action) and throw their spears, one at Bob and one at Eve
each using a quick attack (1/2 action)."

=== Reveal
The players and the *Narrator* reveal the characters' actions.

=== Respond
Characters with any of their action remaining can now use it to
respond to the actions of other characters.

_Example_: "Eve has half an action remaining and uses it to
attempt to dodge the spear thrown at her."

=== Roll
The *Narrator* and players make any necessary rolls to resolve
the actions. All actions are resolved simultaneously and the
consequences of any damage or other effects are determined in
the tidy phase.

_Example_: "Bob rolls to cast his spell, Alice rolls to attack
with her bow, Eve rolls (but with a penalty dice for using a
half action). Each of the Goblins move (no roll required) and
then roll to attack with their spears (each with a penalty dice)
. Eve also gets to roll to dodge the spear thrown at her, again
with a penalty dice as it is a half action."

=== Tidy
Any characters with zero or fewer chances remaining are removed
from the combat (and maybe the game). Any other effects are
applied ready for the start of the next round.
