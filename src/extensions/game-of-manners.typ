= Game of Manners

== Description
This extension adds a novel danger mechanic to the game
where players lose chances (or some other resource) if they
fail to follow a set of rules.

== Mechanics
Players must follow a pre-defined set of rules. These rules
are typically inspired by the setting of the game, for example
a game set in Regency England might have rules about how to
conduct oneself in polite society.

If a player fails to follow the rules then they lose a chance.

A good set of rule will have some of the following properties:
- Easy for the players to understand once known
- Create a tension between following the rules and achieving
  other goals in the game
- Can be broken deliberately via choice or accidentally by
  failing a roll

=== Variation: Known rules
The rules are known to the players from the start of the game.

*Example:* _In a game set in Regency England the rules might
require players to have excellent table manners. At any
point during a meal the Narrator may call for a roll to
determine the quality of a character's manners and therefore
whether they have broken the rules._

=== Variation: Unknown rules
The rules are hidden from the players at the start of the
game and part of the game is discovering them.

When using this variation you may require additional
mechanics to randomize the rules used each game to ensure a
good level of re-playability.

*Example:* _In a game set in an esoteric cult characters'
aren't allowed to mention the color yellow. The players
don't know this to begin with and must discover it through
play._
