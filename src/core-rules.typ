= Open D12 Core Rules

== Introduction
#text(style:"italic")[Open d12 is a rules system for creating table top role playing games. It is not a game in itself but a set of rules that can be used to create a wide variety of games. The rules are designed to be simple and flexible, allowing players and narrators to create and play games in a wide variety of settings and genres.

The best way to think of Open d12 is as a set of recipes for creating games where some of the ingredients will need to be decided by the authors.]

== For Players
- One or more d12s
- Paper and something to write with
- _optionally_ a copy of the rules

== For the Narrator
- One or more d12s
- Something to write with
- A copy of the rules

= Game Rules
To create a game using Open d12 you will need to decide on the following:
- The setting of the game
- The *skill groups* and *skills* that will be used when creating characters
- Which, if any, extensions you are using

== Skill Groups
In open d12 characters have a number of *skill groups*. These represent a character's broad areas of expertise. When creating a character players invest points into these *skill groups* to represent their character's abilities. The points invested into a *skill group* typically determine the *skill level* for all of the skills belonging to that group.

The minimum value for a *skill group* is one and the maximum value is nine. You may wish to further restrict the maximum value a character can start the game with. A character with 9 in a skill, especially with a *bonus die* will succeed about 90% of the time.

It is recommended you have between three and six *skill groups* in your game. The more skill groups you have the more complex your game will be.

*Example:* _If you are making a simple 'sword and sorcery' game then you might decide on the following skill groups: Might, Finesse and Knowledge._

== Skills
A *skill* is a specific ability that a character might want to perform. *Skills* belong to a *skill group*, with related skills belonging to the same group. A character's *skill level* is typically determined by the number of points they have invested in the *skill group*.

It is recommended that each group has the same number of skills and that you have between two and four *skills* in each *skill group*. The more skills you have the greater the chance they wont all be used. However, too few skills can get in the way of players being able to create the characters they want.

*Example:* _Building on the simple example above you might decide to have the following skills belonging to the following groups. Might: Attack, Defense. Finesse: Aim, Stealth. Knowledge: Arcana, Lore._

=== Specialization
To make characters more unique they can specialize in one or more skills. When a character specializes in a skill they gain a *bonus die* when rolling that skill.

= Character Creation
The basics of character creation involve determining how many points are invested in each *skill group* and if the character is specialized in any *skills*.

It is also important for characters to have a name, a description and a background that ties them into the setting.

You will need to decide how many points are available for players to invest, how many can be invested into any one skill at the start of the game and how many skills can be specialized in.

*Example:* _For our simple 'sword and sorcery' game we might decide that players have 9 points to invest in their character's skill groups and that they can invest a maximum of 6 points into any one group. As skill groups start at 1 this means the maximum starting value for any skill group will be 7. We'll also let players pick 1 skill for their characters to specialize in._

You may want to tie specialization in certain skills to a particular background or profession. This isn't covered in the core rules but there are extensions that go into more detail.

= Playing the game

== The Narrator
The role of the Narrator is to facilitate the game. Their goal is to create a fun, challenging and engaging environment for the players to explore and tell stories in. They have three main responsibilities: 

*Describe the game world and non-player characters.* The Narrator describes what is happening in the part of the game world the players are interacting with and how it looks, feels, sounds, smells, and tastes. They also describe the actions and appearance of any non-player characters who are present. They also answer questions from the players about the game world and non-player characters, although they may choose to keep some information secret or require a *roll* to reveal certain pieces of information.

*Provide just enough direction to move the story forward.* The Narrator provides one or more 'story hooks' to give the player characters a reason to act and provides a source of challenge, story-conflict and tension. The Narrator needs to make characters earn their successes and feel their failures. They also need to prevent characters from getting totally stuck.

*Use the game rules (and their own judgement) to determine the outcomes of actions.* The Narrator helps the players to navigate the rules and determines what happens when a roll succeeds or fails. It is important that the Narrator acts fairly and consistently when applying the rules and determining outcomes and that they generally act in the interests of keeping the game fun, challenging and engaging.

== The Players
The role of the players is to take on the role of a character in the game world. Their goals is to explore the world and their characters by interacting with the game and the rules.

Players ask the Narrator questions about the game world and decide what their characters do, say and try. They also decide _how_ their characters try to do things.

Players don't have specific responsibilities but it is recommended that they prefer working together to solve problems, have a high level understanding of the rules and their characters and, most importantly, have fun.

== Roles and resolution
When a player attempts something uncertain or risky the *Narrator* will ask them to make
a *roll* using the *skill* that most closely matches the action they are attempting. The player will roll one or more d12s (based on the *bonuses* and *penalties* involved in the roll) to determine the *result* of the roll.

The *result* is compared to the *skill level* of the *character* for the chosen *skill*. A result of equal to or less than the skill level is a *success*, a result higher than the skill level is a *failure*.

*Bonus Dice*: If the *roll* involves one or more *bonus dice* then the player rolls a number of d12s equal to one plus the number of bonus dice they have and uses the lowest number on any of the dice as the *result*.

*Penalty Dice*: If the *roll* involves one or more *penalty dice* then the player rolls a number of d12s equal to one plus the number of penalty dice they have and use the highest number on any of the dice as the *result*.

*Bonus and penalty dice*: *Bonus* and *penalty dice* cancel each other out. For example if a *roll* involves two penalty dice and one bonus die then they player would make the roll with one penalty die.

*Neutral Rolls*: If the *roll* has no *bonus* or *penalty dice* then the player rolls a single d12 and uses the *result*.

== Determining bonus and penalty dice
*Bonus dice* can come from three sources. A character may be *specialized* in a *skill*, granting them a *bonus dice* when rolling that skill. The *Narrator* may grant a *bonus dice* based on the in-game circumstances surrounding the *roll*, for example preparation and planning by the characters or having the right tools for the job. Finally some items or conditions may grant situational *bonus dice*.

*Penalty dice* come from the difficulty of a given role, either because the task is inherently difficult or because the specific situation is making things more difficult. The Narrator determines how many *penalty dice* are involved in a given roll.

== Danger and threat
In the core version of the rules each character has three *chances* to avoid serious harm or negative consequences. Characters are typically given a chance to perform a *roll* to avoid harm. If they fail the *roll* then they lose a *chance*. If they lose all of their *chances* then they are out of the game - this could mean they are dead, captured, unconscious or otherwise unable to continue, depending on the setting.

=== Regaining chances
The *Narrator* may allow characters to regain *chances* by resting, healing or through other in-game actions.
