# Open D12

## What is it?

Open D12 is a rules system for creating tabletop role playing
games. It is made of some 'minimal but complete' [core rules](https://github.com/Dice-Punk-Press/open-d12/blob/main/src/core-rules.typ)
plus a number of optional [extensions](https://github.com/Dice-Punk-Press/open-d12/tree/main/src/extensions).

## Design Goals

Foster the creation of fun and interesting character driven
games set in fascinating words as a way for people to connect
with one another.

- Prefer simple over complex mechanics
- Avoid exceptions and special cases in the rules
- Make information easy for players to find and understand
- Keep the core rules small and easy to understand
- Trust players and the Narrator to do what's right for the 
  story - don't over design or over specify

## How does it work?

See: [The Core Rules](https://github.com/Dice-Punk-Press/open-d12/blob/main/src/core-rules.typ)

## Project Status

Open d12 is in active development and currently in the alpha
stage, we'd really value feedback and active play testing. We
have a number of projects using this system internally at
[Dice Punk Press](https://dicepunk.press) which we're using to
move the project forwards.

## Is there a .pdf or HTML version of the rules?

There will be soon. Right now you can generate your own using
[Typst](typst.app).
